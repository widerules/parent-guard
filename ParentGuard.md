## Objective ##

Guard your phone and your child from misbehaving, by restricting the phones use. A classic example would be a woman who found out that she had to pay a $500.00 bill to her phone company because her child with an Android phone went app crazy and got everything she could. Or lending the phone out to someone, they can’t read your texts, emails or change your language on you as a prank, also letting you see what exactly they did.
