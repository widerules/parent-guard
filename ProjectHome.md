Parent Guard, a comprehensive mobile application that allows a parent, or any other, to toggle a guard switch, only letting predetermined applications run.

With powerful defensive code that automatically runs when the phone starts, it can NOT be stopped in any way without administrative authorization. No process-ending task-manager or package removal utility can shut it down. Nor is there any “close” button to speak of.
